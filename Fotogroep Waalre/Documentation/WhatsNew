2.2.0 (build 4xxx) xx-09-22
---------------------------

• minimum requirement is iOS 15.5

Design notes:
• add latestImage_ field to MemberPortfolio table
- create new Git branch to hold major feature. Name:
- add getter/setter for latestImage field to MemberPortfolio class
  if latestImage_ == nil, return dummy image with app logo else return latestImage_ from database
- initially read index.xml file for one fixed member (Peter) from Fotogroep_Waalre_App.swift
  Use this to update latestImage_ in CoreData model
- asynchronously read index.xml file for every member and fills latestImage_ field in database

[Github issues]

Settings
Compatibility
Usability
Robustness

TODO Difficult
! fix concurrency
- internationalization
? register CoreData into CoreSpotlight according to WWDC21
- introduce "shared" pattern (thus killing PersistenceController?)
! follow concurrency guidelines of https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10019/

TODO Cleanup Easy
- rename loadMembersFromServer & loadMembersFromCode
- define photoClubID as a struct instead of (name: String, town: String) tuple. Prevents repeated typedef code.
- remove TestMembersProvider
? rename Bundle Identifier from com.vdhamer.Fotogroep-Waalre2 to com.vdhamer.Fotogroep-Waalre (to force upgrading)
- fix refresh in iOS15
- move loadMembers from init to new loadMembers function (to allow refresh to work correctly?)
