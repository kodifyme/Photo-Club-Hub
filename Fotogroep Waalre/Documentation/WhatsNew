2.2.0 (Github hash c9f0d16) 08-10-22
------------------------------------------------

* This is build 4573 in Apple's App Store
* Minimum required iOS version is now 16.0 (16.0 is available for iPhone, 16.x is expected soon for iPad).
* Portfolios screen
    * Displays a (temp hardcoded) thumbnail image per portfolio for all current members of the FGW club
    * Increased font size (on iPad only) within the Portfolio list.
    * If no recent image is available yet (e.g. ex-members), a stylised question mark is shown.
    * While downloading the thumbnail, a sketch of an anxious-looking snail is shown (only visible if download takes a while).
    * Incidentally, both the question-mark and the snail were generated using Stable Diffusion text-to-image software.
    * The App Store videos and screenshots have been updated to reflect the new thumbnails.
* Photo Clubs screen
    * Swipe-left to delete an unneeded photo club (usually not needed). FGW can be deleted, but will reappears on restart.
    * Added a brief explanation at the bottom of the screen (about swiping and more).

* Who's Who screen
    * Extended list of birthdays (still hardcoded) to cover all current members of FGW.
* Preferences screen
    * Minor text change (single to double quotes)

TODO Difficult
! fix concurrency
- internationalization
? register CoreData into CoreSpotlight according to WWDC21
- introduce "shared" pattern (thus killing PersistenceController?)
! follow concurrency guidelines of https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10019/

TODO Cleanup Easy
- rename loadMembersFromServer & loadMembersFromCode
- define photoClubID as a struct instead of (name: String, town: String) tuple. Prevents repeated typedef code.
- remove TestMembersProvider
? rename Bundle Identifier from com.vdhamer.Fotogroep-Waalre2 to com.vdhamer.Fotogroep-Waalre (to force upgrading)
- fix refresh in iOS15
- move loadMembers from init to new loadMembers function (to allow refresh to work correctly?)
