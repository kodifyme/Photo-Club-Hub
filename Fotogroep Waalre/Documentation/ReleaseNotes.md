#### TODO Difficult

* fix concurrency
* internationalization
* register CoreData into CoreSpotlight according to WWDC21
* introduce "shared" pattern (thus killing PersistenceController?)
* follow concurrency guidelines of https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10019/

#### TODO Cleanup Easy

* rename loadMembersFromServer & loadMembersFromCode
* define photoClubID as a struct instead of (name: String, town: String) tuple. Prevents repeated typedef code.
* remove TestMembersProvider
* rename Bundle Identifier from com.vdhamer.Fotogroep-Waalre2 to com.vdhamer.Fotogroep-Waalre (to force upgrading)
* fix refresh in iOS15
* move loadMembers from init to new loadMembers function (to allow refresh to work correctly?)
