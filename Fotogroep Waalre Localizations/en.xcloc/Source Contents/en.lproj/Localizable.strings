"Paragraph_1.2" = "This app presents selected images by the members of supported photo clubs. It does this in a uniform way across the photographers and clubs to avoid the hassle of having to find the various websites and discovering how to navigate each one. Simplicity is further achieved by focusing on one goal: to present the images with minimal distraction. The app thus will not (and cannot)  replace websites. Instead, it actually provides links to each club's website in case the user needs other types of information.";

/* Third paragraph in Waalre section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_1.3" = "This app was originally named _Fotogroep (Photo Club) Waalre_ after one single photo club in The Netherlands. The word 'Hub' in the new name reflects the hope that the app can help stengthen the bonds between the clubs.";

/* Fourth paragraph in Waalre section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_1.4" = "At a pragmatic level, supporting multiple photo clubs requires more than the ability to display a list of clubs, their members and the selected photos per member. Clubs need to be able to provide that information and update it whenever needed without central support or programming skills. The app's [GitHub site](https://GitHub.com/vdhamer/Photo-Club-Hub#readme) explains the current status and sketches plans how to further improve this.";

/* Second paragraph in The App on Readme page */
"Paragraph_2.2" = "The main screen of the app shown a series of ***photo clubs***. Each photo club, in turn, contains a series of member ***portfolios***. The portfolios contain the actual images.";

/* Third paragraph in The App on Readme page */
"Paragraph_2.3" = "Each portfolio thus covers the subset of the photographer's work that is associated with that photo club. A photographer could have more than one portfolio in this app, if the photographer was (at some point in time) a member of multiple photo clubs.";

/* Fourth paragraph in The App on Readme page */
"Paragraph_2.4" = "Each portfolio is shown in chronological order, with the latest work shown first, and typical spans multiple years.";

/* Fifth paragraph in The App on Readme page */
"Paragraph_2.5" = "We try to show the portfolios with **minimal distraction**. Web sites are often less optimal for this because they need to show browser controls (e.g., an address bar or tabs) and serve multiple purposes (e.g., show club news or contact information).";

/* Sixth paragraph in the App on Readme page */
"Paragraph_2.6" = "For Photo Club Waalre, we chose to also include the work of former club members. By default, former members are not visible, but you can configure the app to show them.";

"Paragraph_3.1" = "__Web sites__\nWe regularly add features to the app. This requires some care, because we still want to maintain our focus on providing an optimal viewing experience. The app therefore explicitly does _not_ aim to replace existing websites, but instead provides links to these websites.";

/* Second paragraph in The Features section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_3.2" = "__Languages__\nThe app supports English and Dutch. iOS automatically selects the app's language based on your device’s language settings (_Settings > General > Language & Region > Preferred Language Order_). iOS also allows you to overrule this choice per app (_Settings > Photo Club Waalre > Language_).";

Don't worry - if the person is still a club member, that person will reappear the next time the app synchronizes its local data with online data. This swiping can be useful to remove members who are no longer on the online data members lists. In any case, swipe as much as you like (after all, it just might be therapeutical).";

/* Third paragraph in Prelude section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_4.3" = "Tapping ***inside*** the image allows you to zoom in or out to your heart's content. Tapping ***outside*** the image area ends the animation.

/* First paragraph SupportedPlatforms section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_5.1" = "The app runs on iPhone and iPad and requires iOS 16.4 or higher. Most iOS users tend to upgrade to the latest possible iOS version, which means that the app supports devices made in the last 5 or 6 years.";

/* Second paragraph SupportedPlatforms section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_5.2" = "The app uses various Apple software technologies including Swift (a programming language), SwiftUI (a user interface framework), Core Data (local data storage), Metal (graphics acceleration), concurrency (for fetching data), and animations.";

/* Third paragraph SupportedPlatforms section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_5.3" = "The benefit of an iOS focus is that it allows the developers to focus on functionality rather than cross-platform and cross-version interoperability issues.";

/* Fourth paragraph SupportedPlatforms section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_5.4" = "The drawback, however, is the lack of Android support, because the Android universe has its own set of software technologies. Apps that choose to support multiple platforms require more development effort and often contain more technical compromises.";

/* Fifth paragraph SupportedPlatforms section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_5.5" = "There is another perspective on not targeting Android anytime soon: it implies the app cannot contain any essentially functionality for which there is no alternative. So, again, the app cannot replace a club's website.";

/* Sixth paragraph SupportedPlatforms section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_5.6" = "To put the app's device support into perspective, consider the top-6 software environments. The top-6 platforms are, in [largest-first order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S9PBgS8HS8): web, Android, Windows, iOS, iPadOS. Only the very largest apps (like MS Word, Twitter, Minecraft, Chrome) manage to cover the full range. But many well-known apps choose to focus their resources: Photoshop (Windows, MacOS, iPadOS), WhatsApp (iOS, Android, web - kind of), Pokémon Go (Android, iOS, iPadOS - kind of). So, covering three of the top-six is a decent enough score for now.";

/* First paragraph Developers section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_6.1" = "You can find this app on GitHub. This allows other software developers to contribute. Getting more developers speeds things up somewhat, but also gives fresh ideas and promotes continuity.";

/* Second paragraph Developers section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_6.2" = "Welcome contributions include adding features, code improvements, ideas on architecture and interface definition, and possibly even a backend.";

/* Third paragraph Developers section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_6.3" = "Contributions that don't require coding are also very welcome: beta testing via TestFlight, feature requests, translations, SVG icons, sound effects, and maybe UI/UX design.";

/* Fourth paragraph Developers section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_6.4" = "A central design challenge for a next stage will be to provide a clean, standardized interface to retrieve data per photo club. The interface is needed to load the data, but also keeps the data within the app up to date. After all, membership data and portfolios change regularly. The current interface is essentially a plug-in design with an adaptor per photo club. This needs to be replaced by a standard data interface to avoid having to extend the source code whenever a new club comes aboard.";

/* Fifth paragraph Developers section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_6.5" = "The app currently uses a software module per club. That module loads membership and portfolio data from the club’s server and merges it into the in-app database. For Photo Club Waalre, the membership data is read from a HTML table on a password protected part of the club’s [website](https://www.FotogroepWaalre.nl). The portfolios use a somewhat more robust solution: they are read from XML files generated by a Lightroom Web plug-in called [JuiceBox-Pro](https://www.juicebox.net/tour/). Thus portfolios are created and managed as Lightroom *collections*. These collections are then uploaded to the webserver with a single _Upload_ click (thus triggering JuiceBox-Pro) where they can be downloaded by the app.";

/* Sixth paragraph Developers section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_6.6" = "Software developers or other volunteers who are willing to help can contact us via github@vdhamer.com. Regarding the required level of development experience: you should be good to go if you have created a complete SwiftUI app before. Alternatively, an experienced developer who is learning SwiftUI would also fit the bill. Recommended courses for learning SwiftUI are Hacking with Swift's practical [100 days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) or Stanford's fast paced and more academic online [CS193p course](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu).";

/* First paragraph Model section of Readme page */

The model is a [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema) or information model in the database sense, or “Model“ in the sense of the [Model-View-ViewModel](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/introducing-mvvm-into-your-swiftui-project) design pattern. The app uses a Swift-style MVVM design, meaning model data is stored in structs rather than in classes.";

/* Second paragraph Model section of Readme page */
"Paragraph_7.2" = "The model: every **PhotoClub** has **Members** of various types (current, former, etc.), while some Members have a formal role like chairman within the PhotoClub. Some of **Photographer**'s data (like name and birthday) are unrelated to being a Member of a PhotoClub. **Portfolios** represent the body of work of a Photographer in the context of a PhotoClub. A Portfolio contains **Images**, but an Image could be in multiple Portfolios depending on where the Image was shared. Member and Portfolio can technically be considered synonyms from a modeling perspective: we create exactly one Portfolio for each PhotoClub that a Photographer joined. They are thus a single table in the database.";
