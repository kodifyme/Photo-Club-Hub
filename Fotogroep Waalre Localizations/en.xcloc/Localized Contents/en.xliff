        <source>The app currently uses a software module per club. That module loads membership and portfolio data from the club’s server and merges it into the in-app database. For Photo Club Waalre, the membership data is read from a HTML table on a password protected part of the club’s [website](https://www.FotogroepWaalre.nl). The portfolios use a somewhat more robust solution: they are read from XML files generated by a Lightroom Web plug-in called [JuiceBox-Pro](https://www.juicebox.net/tour/). Thus portfolios are created and managed as Lightroom *collections*. These collections are then uploaded to the webserver with a single _Upload_ click (thus triggering JuiceBox-Pro) where they can be downloaded by the app.</source>

        <source>The model: every **PhotoClub** has **Members** of various types (current, former, etc.), while some Members have a formal role like chairman within the PhotoClub. Some of **Photographer**'s data (like name and birthday) are unrelated to being a Member of a PhotoClub. **Portfolios** represent the body of work of a Photographer in the context of a PhotoClub. A Portfolio contains **Images**, but an Image could be in multiple Portfolios depending on where the Image was shared. Member and Portfolio can technically be considered synonyms from a modeling perspective: we create exactly one Portfolio for each PhotoClub that a Photographer joined. They are thus a single table in the database.</source>
